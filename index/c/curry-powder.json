        "In a dry fry pan over medium-high heat, combine the coriander, mustard, fenugreek, cumin, peppercorns, cloves and chilies. Dry-fry the spices, shaking the pan constantly to prevent them from burning, until they are fragrant, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl, add the chickpeas and turmeric and let cool.",
        "When completely cool, transfer the spice mixture to a mortar, blender or coffee grinder reserved solely for spices and pound or process (in batches if necessary) until finely powdered. Use immediately, or store in a tightly sealed glass jar in a cool, dry place for up to 3 months. Makes 1/2 cup."
