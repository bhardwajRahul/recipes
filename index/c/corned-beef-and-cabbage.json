        "Tie the thyme and parsley sprigs together with kitchen string. Rinse the brisket, put it in a large, heavy pot and add water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, skimming off any foam from the surface. Add the herb bundle, bay leaves and peppercorns, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and simmer gently until the brisket is almost tender, 2 1/2 to 3 hours.",
        "Add the onions, carrots, potatoes and cabbage wedges and return the liquid to a simmer. Cook until the vegetables and brisket are fully tender, about 25 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, in a bowl, whip the cream until soft peaks form. Fold in the horseradish, then season with salt. Cover and refrigerate the horseradish cream until ready to serve.",
        "Using a slotted spoon, transfer the vegetables to a large platter. Transfer the brisket to a cutting board. Cut the meat across the grain and arrange on the platter with the vegetables. Serve immediately and pass the horseradish cream on the side. Serves 6 to 8.",
