        "In a saucepan, combine the potatoes with lightly salted cold water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, until just tender enough to pierce with a fork, 5 to 7 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, in a large nonstick fry pan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the onion and bell pepper and saut\u00e9 until the onion is tender-crisp, 4 to 5 minutes. Set aside.",
        "Drain the potatoes and place in a bowl. Add the onion and bell pepper; set the fry pan aside and do not wash it. Add the corned beef, milk, chopped parsley and chives to the bowl. Toss to mix well, taking care not to mash the potato pieces. Season with salt and pepper and toss again.",
        "Heat 2 Tbs. of the oil in the reserved fry pan over medium heat. Add the hash mixture, pressing it down with the back of a spatula to form an even, compact cake. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until crusty and lightly browned on the bottom, about 15 minutes. If the hash cake does not move freely, use the spatula to loosen the edges. Invert a large heatproof plate over the pan. Using oven mitts, firmly hold the pan and plate together and invert them. Lift off the pan.",
        "Heat the remaining 2 Tbs. oil in the same pan and slide the hash cake, browned side up, back into it, tucking any stray pieces back into place. Cook until the other side is crusty, about 10 minutes more. Unmold onto the same plate and cut into wedges. Garnish with parsley sprigs and serve hot. Serves 4."
