        "In a small bowl, combine the salt, pepper and garlic powder. In a large bowl, toss the wings with the salt mixture to evenly coat.",
        "Preheat a gas grill to medium heat (about 350 degrees F).",
        "Place the wings on the grill, crowding them together so that they are all touching (this goes against the conventional wisdom of giving meat room so it doesn't steam\u00bfyou want them to steam so that they stay moist). Grill, flipping the wings every 5 minutes, for a total of 20 minutes of cooking.",
        "In the meantime, heat the butter, hot sauce, vinegar and honey in a saucepan over low heat and whisk to combine.",
        "In a clean large bowl, toss the wings with the sauce. Turn the heat up on the grill to medium high. Use tongs to remove the wings from the sauce and put them back on the grill until the skins crisp, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Put the wings back in the bowl with the sauce, toss and serve."
