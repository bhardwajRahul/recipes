        "While the potatoes are cooking, place the bacon and some salt in a large saute pan. Cook over medium-low heat until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and add it to the bowl with the potatoes. Add the onions and a pinch of salt to the hot pan and cook until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken stock, vinegar, mustard and chives and bring to a boil. Pour the dressing over the potatoes and toss to coat.",
