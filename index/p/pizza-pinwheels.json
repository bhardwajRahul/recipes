        "On a lightly floured surface, roll 1 package of the dough into a 12-inch (30-cm) square about 1/8 inch (3 mm) thick. Cut the square into 6 equal strips, each 12 by 2 inches (30 by 5 cm). Repeat with the second package of dough.",
        "Evenly spread 1 1/2 Tbs. of the pesto on 6 of the strips and 1 1/2 Tbs. of the tomato sauce on the remaining strips. Sprinkle each with about 1 Tbs. of the cheese. Starting at the short side of a strip, roll the strip tightly into a pinwheel. Pinch the seam to seal. Place the pinwheel, flat side down, in a prepared muffin cup. Repeat with the remaining strips. Brush the tops of the pinwheels lightly with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper.",
        "Bake until the edges are crispy and the dough is cooked through, 20 to 23 minutes. Serve warm. Makes 12 pinwheels.",
