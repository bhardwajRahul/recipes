        "Put the pork in a bowl, sprinkle with the salt and pepper and stir to coat.",
        "In a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, warm the oil. Working in batches, add the pork and cook until well browned on all sides, 6 to 7 minutes per batch. Transfer to a plate.",
        "Add the onions to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger, curry vindaloo, cumin, paprika and turmeric and cook, stirring constantly, until the spices are fragrant and evenly coat the onions, about 1 minute. Add the vinegar and stir to scrape up the browned bits from the pan bottom. Return the pork to the pot, add the broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, partially cover the pot and cook until the pork is very tender and the sauce has thickened, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.",
        "Divide the steamed rice, pork and sauce among warmed plates and serve immediately. Serves 6 to 8.",
