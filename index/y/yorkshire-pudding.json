        "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).",
        "Pour off drippings from roast beef and measure out desired amount (about 1/2 cup should do). Pour drippings into a 9x12 inch baking dish and place into the oven until the drippings sizzle. Pour the batter over the drippings and bake for 30 minutes (or until the sides have risen and are golden brown). Cut into eight portions and serve immediately."
