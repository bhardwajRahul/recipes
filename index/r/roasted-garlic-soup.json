        "Roast the garlic",
        "Preheat an oven to 325\u00b0F.",
        "Arrange the garlic heads, cut side up, in a shallow baking dish. Drizzle with 2 Tbs. of the olive oil and cover the dish loosely with aluminum foil. Roast until the cloves are very tender when pierced with a fork, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. When the heads are cool enough to handle, squeeze the soft garlic pulp into a bowl.",
        "Fry the bread",
        "In a fry pan over medium-high heat, warm the remaining 2 Tbs. olive oil. When it is hot, add the bread slices, reduce the heat to medium and fry the bread, turning once, until golden, about 4 minutes total. Remove from the heat.",
        "Finish the soup",
        "In a saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the broth and garlic pulp, bring to a simmer and cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes.",
        "Using a food processor or blender, process the soup to a smooth puree. Return the soup to the pan and reheat to serving temperature. Season with salt and pepper. Place 2 fried bread slices in each bowl, ladle the soup over them and serve immediately. Serves 4.",
