        "In a large, shallow pan over high heat, bring the milk and cream to a boil, stirring frequently to prevent scorching. Add the rice, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is reduced to the consistency of custard and the rice is soft and creamy, about 50 minutes. Add the jaggery and mix well.",
        "Meanwhile, pry open the cardamom pods, remove the seeds and grind them to a powder. (This is best done using a mortar and pestle; you can also wrap the seeds in plastic wrap and crush them with a mallet or rolling pin.) Discard the cardamom skins. Add the cardamom, saffron, raisins and almonds to the cooked rice mixture and mix well. Transfer to a bowl, let cool, then cover and refrigerate until chilled.",
        "Spoon the pudding into small dessert bowls and garnish with silver foil."
