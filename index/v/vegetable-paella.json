        "Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a 10-inch saute pan with a lid. Add the onion and celery and saute until beginning to soften, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic, cherry tomatoes and salt and cook an additional 6 minutes, until the tomatoes begin to break down. Add the radishes and saute another 2 minutes. Add the vermouth and allow it to reduce by half. Add the chicken broth and then the saffron, rubbing it between your fingers to crumble a bit. Bring to a simmer and stir in the rice and the green beans. Simmer over medium-high heat, uncovered, for 5 minutes without disturbing. Scatter the red peppers and peas over the top and gently press them into the rice mixture; do not stir. Reduce the heat to medium, cover and simmer for 7 minutes. Uncover, raise the heat to high and cook for 3 minutes more, to make sure all the liquid is evaporated and to help develop a crust on the bottom. Remove the pan from the heat, cover and let rest for 5 minutes. Uncover, sprinkle with the smoked paprika and the parsley and serve."
