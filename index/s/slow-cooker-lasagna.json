        "In the stovetop-safe insert of slow cooker over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the sausage and cook, breaking up any large chunks with a wooden spoon, until the meat is browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Add the tomato sauce and water and bring to a simmer. Transfer the sauce to a large bowl.",
        "In another bowl, stir together the ricotta, parsley, salt and pepper. Set aside.",
        "Spread a thin layer of the sauce on the bottom of the slow-cooker insert. Cover the sauce with a single layer of uncooked lasagna noodles (about 3), breaking the noodles as needed to fit. Spread about 1/3 cup of the ricotta mixture over the noodles. Top with about 2 cups of the sauce, then sprinkle with about 1 cup of the mozzarella and 1/4 cup of the Parmigiano-Reggiano. Repeat the layering 4 more times, starting with the noodles.",
        "Transfer the insert to the slow-cooker base, cover and cook on low according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions until the noodles are tender and cooked through, about 4 hours.",
        "Position a rack in the center of an oven and preheat to broil.",
        "Transfer the slow-cooker insert to the oven and broil until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Let the lasagna rest for 20 minutes before serving. Garnish with basil and serve immediately. Serves 12.",
