        "Cut the ends off each orange. Cut the oranges in half crosswise and remove the seeds. Place the orange halves in a food processor and process until roughly pureed. Transfer to a nonreactive bowl. Add the rhubarb, strawberries and sugar and toss gently to combine. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up to overnight.",
        "Have ready 7 hot, sterilized half-pint jars and their lids. Place 2 or 3 small plates in the freezer.",
        "Transfer the rhubarb mixture to a large nonreactive saucepan and add the lemon juice. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, reduce the heat to medium and cook, uncovered, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat. To test if the jam is ready, put 1 tsp. of the jam on a chilled plate and place in the freezer for 2 minutes. The jam is ready if it wrinkles when nudged gently with a finger. If it doesn\u2019t, continue to cook for 1 to 2 minutes more, remove from the heat and test again on a clean chilled plate.",
        "Ladle the hot jam into the jars, leaving 1/4 inch of headspace. Remove any air bubbles and adjust the headspace, if necessary. Wipe the rims clean and seal tightly with the lids.",
        "Process the jars in a boiling-water bath for 10 minutes. The sealed jars can be stored in a cool, dark place for up to 1 year. If a seal has failed, store the jar in the refrigerator for up to 1 month. Makes 7 half-pint jars.",
