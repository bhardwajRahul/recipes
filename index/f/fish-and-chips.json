        "Put the mayonnaise in a medium bowl and whisk in the onion, mustard, capers, cornichons, lemon zest, lemon juice and the cooled saffron vinegar mixture. Stir until combined and season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 8 hours to allow the flavors to meld. Stir in the parsley just before serving.",

        "Whisk together the beer, rice flour, breadcrumbs and salt and pepper until smooth, adding more beer if needed. The batter should be just thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.",
        "Whisk together the flour, cayenne and some salt and pepper on a plate. Season the halibut on both sides with salt and pepper, dredge in the seasoned flour and tap off the excess.",
        "Dip the fish in the batter and let the excess run off. Fry the fish in batches, until golden brown on both sides and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and season with salt. Serve with the saffron tartar sauce, sherry vinegar and tartar sauce and chips. Garnish with the fried parsley, if desired."
