        "Prepare a hot fire in a grill. Turn the center burner to medium-low heat or arrange the coals so the center of the grill is at medium-low heat and the edges are at high heat. Lightly brush a steel grill pizza pan with olive oil.",
        "On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pizza dough into a 12-inch (30-cm) round and transfer to the prepared pizza pan. Spread the sauce evenly on the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch (12-mm) border uncovered. Sprinkle with the mozzarella cheese. Top with the chicken, onion and jalape\u00f1o.",
        "Place the pizza pan in the center of the grill and cover the grill. Bake until the crust is crisp and well browned and the cheese is melted, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer the pizza to a cutting board and top with the cotija cheese and cilantro leaves. Cut into slices and serve immediately. Serves 2 to 4.",
