        "Increase the heat to medium-high. Working in batches, brown the beef on all sides, 3 to 5 minutes per batch. Transfer the beef to a large bowl.",
        "Reduce the heat to medium and warm the olive oil. Add the onions and carrots and saut\u00e9 until almost softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme and bay leaves and saut\u00e9 for about 30 seconds. Stir in the flour and cook until lightly colored, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the wine, stirring to scrape up the browned bits from the pan bottom. Add the stock, demi-glace and the reserved pancetta and bring to a simmer. Return the beef to the pan, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer until the meat is tender, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.",
        "Remove the bay leaves and discard. Taste and adjust the seasonings with salt and pepper. Serve the stew over buttered parsleyed noodles and garnish with parsley. Serves 8 to 10."
